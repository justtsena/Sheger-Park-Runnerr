# Sheger-Park-Runnerr
Sheger Park Runner is a 2D endless runner game built with Python and Pygame. The player runs through Sheger Park, jumps with gravity physics, avoids moving obstacles, and earns points over time. The project focuses on learning game development basics, including animations, scoring, and start/game-over screens.
