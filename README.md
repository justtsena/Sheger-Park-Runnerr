## 🎮 Project Overview

**Sheger Park Runner** is a 2D endless runner game developed using **Python** and **Pygame**.
The player runs through **Sheger Park**, jumps over obstacles, avoids collisions, and tries to achieve the highest possible score.

This project was built to learn **game development fundamentals**, including physics, animation, collision detection, and real-time gameplay logic, while also showcasing **Ethiopian culture and identity** through visuals and language.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

* Learn Python game development using Pygame
* Practice real-time logic such as gravity, jumping, and collision handling
* Build a complete playable game from scratch
* Create a culturally inspired game representing Ethiopia

---

## 🕹️ Game Objective

* Run endlessly through Sheger Park
* Jump and avoid obstacles
* Survive as long as possible
* Earn the highest score

---

## 👥 Target Audience

* Players who enjoy simple and fun arcade-style games
* Beginners interested in Python and game development
* Local players who want to see Ethiopian culture represented in games

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Game Library:** Pygame
* **Assets:**

  * Player sprites
  * Obstacles
  * Background images (Sheger Park & Ethiopian landmarks)

---

## ✨ Game Features

* Gravity and jumping mechanics
* Dynamic obstacle generation and movement
* Scoring system based on survival time
* Player animation
* Start screen and Game Over screen
* Real-time collision detection

## 🇪🇹 Cultural Representation

### 🗣️ Use of Amharic Language

* Game texts and messages are displayed in **Amharic**
* Makes the game accessible to local players
* Promotes the use of Ethiopian languages in technology

### 🧥 Traditional Ethiopian Clothing

* Player character wears traditional clothing such as **Netela / Kaba**
* Encourages cultural pride and representation in digital games

### 🏢 Ethiopian Landmarks

* Background includes **Ethiopia’s tallest building**
* Creates familiarity and national identity
* Educates players visually while entertaining them

### 💡 Overall Cultural Impact

This game doesn’t just entertain — it **celebrates Ethiopian culture**, supports local identity in tech, and encourages culturally conscious digital content.

## ❓ Problem This Project Solves

### Lack of Local-Themed Games

Most games do not reflect Ethiopian culture or landmarks.
Sheger Park Runner introduces:

* Local places (Sheger Park)
* Local language (Amharic)
* Local clothing and architecture

It blends a **globally popular game style** with **Ethiopian identity**.
